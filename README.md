<h1>Pygame Library</h1>
<p>This is a library of simple games that I have created with pygame for fun and to supplement my coding skills. Games may be a duplicate of an existing game, or they are my own game. The rest of this read me will illustrate each game I created in order of when I created it.</p>
<h2>Snake</h2>

<p>This is the first game I have created in pygame. The biggest challenge that I had when coding this was trying to get the snake to stay in the grid and also to make the snake longer and follow itself correctly. I solved the first one by slowing down the frame rate so that way it would move the correct number of pixels and input could only happen on the frames where it was in the correct position. To make the snake's body follow itself, I used an array for both the player's x and y coordinate and just moved the coordinates down an index in the array each time the snake moved.</p>
<h2>Ball Bounce Tycoon</h2>

<p>This is the second and probably worst game I have coded. The idea behind this game is that balls bounce around the screen and when they hit a wall you get a point. You can use these points to buy more balls, increase the speed, etc. This game was the worst in terms of both game play and code readability and unnecessary repition. You could probably half the lines of code that I used to reach the same result. However, the game did teach me the basics how collisions and how to implement audio into the game. Also, gameplaywise this game is pretty long in comparison to the other games that I have and plan to create.</p>
<h2>Pong</h2>

<p>You already know pong. This game was pretty simple to code. I didn't learn much from coding this other than it was fun to create the AI that plays against the player, even though that was pretty simple.</p>
<h2>2D PVP</h2>

<p>This game was very ambitious in the new things that I tried to do. The idea of the game is that two players run around a randomly generated vertical 2D map and try to shoot eachother until one runs out of health. I utilized OOP to use classes for both of the players and the bullets in the game. The methods that I created in the players class definetly should have been shorter, but I don't want to go in and change that, since it works. This was my first time applying OOP, and I was very happy that it all worked out. Two of the biggest challenges that I had when creating this game was dealing with the sprites, and making sure that they were orientated correctly depending on the way the player is moving. The second one was dealing with the collision physics. The collision physics was a big step up from what I have used before because it was the first time that I used the hitbox object in the pygame library with motion. However I am still very happy about this game.</p>
