<h1>Pygame Library</h1>
<p>This is a library of simple games that I have created with pygame for fun and to supplement my coding skills. Games may be a duplicate of an existing game, or they are my own game. The rest of this read me will illustrate each game I created in order of when I created it.</p>
<h2>Snake</h2>

<p>This is the first game I have created in pygame. The biggest challenge that I had when coding this was trying to get the snake to stay in the grid and also to make the snake longer and follow itself correctly. I solved the first one by slowing down the frame rate so that way it would move the correct number of pixels and input could only happen on the frames where it was in the correct position. To make the snake's body follow itself, I used an array for both the player's x and y coordinate and just moved the coordinates down an index in the array each time the snake moved.</p>
